The maps made in this repository were created by Calvin Standaert as part of assignment three for the University of Washington's summer 2023 class of GEOG328, taught by Professor Bo Zhao. The first map displays the occurrence of earthquakes near or in Japan, while the second displays the occurrence of invasive New Zealand mud snails in Washington State, USA.

Data for the first map was provided by Professor Zhao, while data in the second map was gathered from the [Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal](https://geo.wa.gov/).
